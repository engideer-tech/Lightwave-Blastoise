						<p class="style1">So in case you were wondering what this is all about ...</p>
						<p class="style1">We recently took a ride to the the <span style="color: blueviolet">purple</span> planet in our personal spaceship, and our dog modelled some scenes through the spaceship door with his 3D-Camera, while the rest of our team was enjoying the blueviolet fluroescence.
						We decided to render a scene from our expedition for this rendering competition, such that it could provide you a glimpse of the adventure we had.</p>
						<p class="style1">Our journey was mostly about being captivated in our beautiful spaceship, while handling the tantrums of our dog. However, it is incomplete if we don't describe the sense of awe attached to the ethereal outwordly beauty. In an attempt to describe this, we ideated a scene that could capture the emotion of awe, the mystery of exploration, and sense of wonder associated with our journey to the purple planet. This ideation looks something like this:</p>
						<article class="box post">
							<p>
							<a href="images/idea.png" class="idea">
								<img src="images/idea.png" alt="" /> 
							</a>
							</p>
						</article>	
						<p class="style1">Imagine the number of emotions stirred when our spaceship door opened up on this mysterious land. This Rendering competition was merely an excuse to explain how exquisite the purple planet is.
							As we wandered in the dream land, we brainstormed ideas to render our imagination. It was clear to us that we atleast need <a href="alphamasking.html">alpha masking</a>, <a href="thinlens.html">a thinlens camera</a>, and <a href="shadingnormals.html">shading normals</a> to reasonably describe the 
							purple planet. We also had to showcase the beautiful <a href="arealights.html">Area Lights</a> that enlightened our dog through the journey. And of course, what image is complete without some <a href="postprocessing.html">post processing</a>.
						</p>
						<p class="style1">With a mix of hardwork and day-dreaming, we finally rendered the ideated scene with our very own renderer! 
						</p>					
						<p class="style3">
						<ul class="actions">
							<li><a href="images/final.jpg" class="button style3 large">Click to view the Rendered image</a></li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p class="style1"><strong>So, why do we deserve to win this competition?</strong></p>
						<p class="style1">We believe that with this rendering, we have expressed several emotions attached to our expedition.
							It not only describes the joy of exploration, and the awe of being on the untouched fluroescent land, but also the mix of emotions brought about by being captivated in a futuristic and gorgeous space shuttle.
							Of course, there are some parts of the expedition which could neither be described by words nor by visual explanations. These will remain close to our hearts, yet never exposed to the world. We strongly believe that 
							we stand a fair chance of winning this competition, as we have successfully brought out the tech-savvy artist in us and showcased the unspoken sensations of our expedition through our rendered image.
