The model in this scene is only shaded with the simple Principled BSDF node with the "Metallic" value cranked up to maximum.
I tried to use some of the metallic materials from BlenderKit, but unfortunately they always came out as black in the rendered view -- even with plenty of lighting and a colorful ground plane.
Since I'm rather a rookie in Blender, I was not yet able to figure out why that is.
